    # NOTE ON SIGNING:
    # To properly build a Release APK, you would need to set up:
    # 1. `key.jks` and `signing.properties` files.
    # 2. Secrets (e.g., ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD) in your repository.
    # This example builds a debug APK which is suitable for testing,
    # but for production release, replace `assembleDebug` with `assembleRelease`
    # and include the necessary signing steps above this build step.
