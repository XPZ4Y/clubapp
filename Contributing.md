How to contribute
=================

Thank you so much for wanting to contribute to Clubspot! Here are a few important
things you should know about contributing:

1.  Backend changes require discussion, use cases, etc. Code comes later. 
2.  Pull requests are great for small fixes for bugs, documentation, etc.
3.  Fork the repository, make improvements, and merge to the main repository.

UI changes
-----------
1. The app uses preact.js as front end (for now)
2. After the required changes in the /project folder, 

[preact.js]: https://preactjs.com/

Pull requests
-------------
Unless the change is a trivial fix such as for a typo, it's generally best to
start by opening a new issue describing the bug or feature you're intending to
fix. Even if you think it's relatively minor, it's helpful to know what people
are working on. And as mentioned above, backend changes should be discussed
thoroughly before moving to code.

Some examples of types of pull requests that are immediately helpful:

  - Improving the UI without disturbing the backend.
  - Fixing or improving documentation.
  - Bug fixes

Guidelines for any code contributions:

  1. Please squash all commits for a change into a single commit (this can be
     done using `git rebase -i`). Do your best to have a
     [well-formed commit message][] for the change.
