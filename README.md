## A Next-Generation Event & Community Platform
ClubSpot redefines how communities organize and participate in events. We foster genuine engagement and accountability through a unique credibility system, ensuring that hosts deliver and participants show up.

## Start contributing:

After pulling the `Shawnpeter578/clubapp` repository, let's set up the environment

In your root directory
```xml
npm install
npm start
```


## Course of action
> 001: creating frontend
> 002: a server serves frontend upon request
> 003: User communicates to the server using frontend, adds events, events sent to mongodb.
> 004: From mongodb, fetch existing events;
> 005: Reputation points, if person who host event never made it there, his credibility drops.
> 006: If person who signed up for the event no show up, credibility drops.
> 007: sign in using phone number only..
